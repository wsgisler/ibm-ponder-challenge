    "# April 2021 - Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Original problem statement: https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/challenges/May2021.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is defined by  $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$ and the recurrence relationship $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We call any sequence  $A_0, A_1, A_2,\\ldots$ Fibonacci-like if it satisfies the recurrences $A_n = A_{n-1}+A_{n-2}$ for all  $n \\ge 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence contains many prime numbers. For instance,  $F_3 = 2, F_{11} = 89$, etc. Our goal is to see how to generate a fibonnaci-like sequence without any prime numbers and relatively prime initial elements. This amounts to finding suitable relatively prime  $A_0$ and  $A_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main step in the generation is finding a set [(p_1, m_1, a_1), (p_2, m_2, a_2),..., (p_t, m_t, a_t)] of triplets of the form (p_k, m_k, a_k) such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $1 \\le a_k \\le m_k$\n",
    "2. For every natural number $n$, we have that for some $k$, $n$ is equivalent to  $a_k modulo  m_k$ (i.e. $m_k$ divides  $n-a_k$).\n",
    "3. $p_k$ is a prime divisor of the Fibonacci number  $F_{m_k}$\n",
    "4. All the  $p_k$ are distinct (the  m_k and  a_k can be non-distinct)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this set, one can generate  $A_0$ and  $A_1$ that satisfy\n",
    "\n",
    " $A_0$ is equivalent to $F_{m_k-a_k}$ modulo  $p_k$\n",
    " $A_1$ is equivalent to $F_{m_k-a_k+1}$ modulo  $p_k$\n",
    " \n",
    "and one can prove that this sequence does not contain any primes by using the following easy-to-prove identity, which holds for any Fibonacci-like sequence:  $A_{m+n} = A_mF_{n-1} + A_{m+1}F_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to find the set [(p_1, m_1, a_1),..., (p_t, m_t, a_t)] of triplets satisfying conditions 1-4 described above. (Hint: A set of 18 elements exists where the only primes dividing its  $m_k$ elements are 2,3 and 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "A bonus \"*\" will be given for computing  $A_0$ and  $A_1$ from the found set, and explaining why every element of  $A_n$ is divisible by one of the  $p_k$ elements, but not equal to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be stated as a MIP. There are different ways of modelling it, but not every way is efficient. For example, I first tried to have binary variables for each possible p, m and a for every possible t (assuming a fixed size of |t|). This turned out not to be efficient enough. An approach where all possible combinations of p, m and a are combined into individual binary variables works better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition 1 and 3 can already be applied when the variables are set up. Condition 4 is very simple to express.\n",
    "Condition 2 is a bit more tricky. Unfortunately, it isn't possible to explicitiely formulate it for every possible $n$, but it seems efficient to just do it for a large enough number (2000 in my case). Also, in order to keep the number of variables limited, we need to make some assumptions about the maximum size of m, a and p. It turned out to work with a relatively limited solution space, but this might not always be the case, so maybe we were a bit lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since condition 2 is not stated explicitely for every possible $n$, we have to check it afterwards (for a large enough testset of $n$)."
