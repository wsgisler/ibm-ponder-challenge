https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/challenges/May2018.html

We have 11 coins, and exactly two of them are counterfeit with slightly smaller weights than the others. Find the two fake coins using just four weighings of a double-pan balance scale.
Supply your answer as four lines of dash-separated lists of the letters A-K corresponding to the coins.

As an example, here is a solution for the case of seven coins:

ADE-BCG
AG-BE
AC-DG

The first weighing checks coins A,D,E on the left pan vs coins B,C,G on the right side, etc.
