    "Proposed solution by Walter Sebastian Gisler, 12/12/2020\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The original problem statement can be found here: https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/challenges/December2020.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simplified version of the USA elector-based election system. In our system, the states are represented by a vector pop = [p1, p2, ..., pn] of odd numbers, given the number of eligible voters in any state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state is allocated a given number of electors in the following manner: There are 1,001 electors in total, and they are assigned to states in proportion to their population. If p = p1+p2+...+pn, then state i receives (pi/p)*1001 electors, rounded down. The remaining electors are allocated one at a time for the states, ordered by the size of the remaining fractional elector (e.g., a state that got 3.5 electors will get another one before a state with 10.25 electors).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if pop = [51, 61, 77, 89, 99] then the electors are [135, 162, 205, 236, 263].\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two candidates in the election. If a candidate receives more than half the votes in a state, she gets all the electors for that state. The candidate with the most electors wins the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vote is a vector [v1, v2,..,vn] that represents the number of votes a candidate received in all the states. The size of a vote is v1+v2+...+vn - the total number of votes for that candidate. A losing vote is a vote that results in losing the election (i.e., not getting enough electors). A losing vote is maximal with respect to a given population vector pop if any vote of a larger size is not a losing vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal: Find a population vector p=[p1, p2, p3, p4, p5] on five states with 101<=pi<= 149 and a maximal losing vote v=[v1, v2, v3, v4, v5] such that the size of v is 71.781305% the size of p up to a millionth of a percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Present your answer in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "[p1, p2, p3, p4, p5]\n",
    "\n",
    "[v1, v2, v3, v4, v5]"

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let's define a method that calculates the number of electors for a given population vector p. I think this got a little bit inefficient due to the sorting, but luckily it isn't a hard problem, so efficiency is not super important."

    "Next, I defined a method to calculate a maximal losing vote. I started by formulating this as a MIP. Obviously, this isn't the most efficient way of doing this, but I figured it wouldn't be bad to have a MIP to be able to check the implementation of a more efficient implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "My second implementation is working as follows: we assume that every possible candidate for a maximal losing vote has 100% votes in some state and is lacking exactly one vote to win all the other states. We now just need to check every subset of populations. We need to check whether this subset would form a losing vote (i.e. if I add up the population in this subset, it has to be smaller than 1001/2. Since we have only 5 states, this can be done efficiently. There are:\n",
    "\n",
    "ncr(5,1) + ncr(5,2) + ncr(5,3) + ncr(5,4) = 5 + 10 + 10 + 5\n",
    "\n",
    "= 20 possible subsets to check. If we had more states, this would very quickly get much bigger numbers, and this method wouldn't work anymore. However, this is essentially a knapsack problem, so there we could still solve this somewhat efficiently using dynamic programming - just in case ;)"

    "Looks correct. Ok, now we just need to check all possible populations where each component of the population vector is between 101 and 149 and an odd number. We can do that with 5 nested loops.

An alternative would be itertools.product, but the disadvantage with this is that we would have permutations of the same population vector, which would be inefficient.
