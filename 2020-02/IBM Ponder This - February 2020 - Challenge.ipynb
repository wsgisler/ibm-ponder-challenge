    "\n",
    "In the famous Snakes and Ladders game, there is a board with 100 squares. You start at square 0 (just outside of the board) and then proceed to advance based on your move, which is dictacted by the throw of a fair dice. If your piece lands on a square that is at the very bottom of a ladder, you climb it. If your turn lands you at the head of a snake, you slide down to the bottom of its tail. And if your turn takes you out of the board (a square > 100), you stay in the square where you are at the time the dice was thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge this month is to design a game with 10 ladders and snakes altogether that will lead to an expected number of moves (rounded to the 6th decimal place) of 66.978705.\n",

    "Pretty good for a \"simple\" approach. But unfortunately it \"doesn't cut the mustard\" as my friend B would say in such situations. I made this a bit more sophistaced, chose the neighborhoods more strategically and added reheats. The accuracy quickly improved to about e-5, but that was it. Even after running it for a whole day it did not find a solution that satisfied the criteria. Obviously, there must be a better way of doing this. Alternatively, I could imagine formulating the expected number of attempts as linear equations. This would result in a large system of linear equations that could be solved for the expected number of attempts to get to the last square. Once we have a formula, we could use Gurobi/ Cplex/ Cpoptimizer to determine where the ladders/ snakes should be located. Unfortunately, it is not easy to solve for this variable. Even a system with just 10 squares takes really long to solve using Matlab and the formula is really long. The 100 square system could not be solved in a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately, I didn't have more time to spend on this, so I finish this challenge unsolved, with a solution that is close to what is required, but not close enough."
