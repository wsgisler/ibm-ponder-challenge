# ibm-ponder-challenge
I occasionally solve the IBM ponder challenges (https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/challenges/March2018.html) and often try to find a solution using a MIP, other optimization techniques or simulations

The code is written in Python (usually 2.7.x, unless stated differently) and often requires PuLP (https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) and sometimes Docplex.
